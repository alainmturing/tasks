Hey there, I recently started my junior year of high school and in my physics class the teAcher has started covering electric fields and charges. I need ytour help to get a better understanding of this so i want you to build an educational widget that I can access in the browser. You should be able to do this in a single html file with css and js. Feel free to leverage bootstrap for the styling and jquery if you need for scripting. But the crux of what I want you to do for me is the following:

- Create me an introduction to electirc fields and charges and a brief description fo what it is and how it works.
- Then I want you to write some instructions for using a visualiztion tool that you will create too. 

The visualization tool should do the following:
- There should be a canvas representing the field that starts off with a negative and a positive charge. Negative on the left, positive on the right.
- The field should accurately represent the elctric field based on the magnitude and positioning of the charges utilizing accurate mathematics and svg arrows to show the electric field and how the charges interact with each other.
- I should be able to drag around any chrage I want and see the field get modified in real time based on the posiitoning of the charges.
- I should be able to add and delete positive and negative charges to the field.
- I should be able to reset the visualization back to just the 2 initial charges.
- I should be able to hide/show the field lines which are the svg arrows I mentioned.
- I should also be able to delete any individual charge I want which will all be added to a scrollable list so that no matter how many charges I add to the field, I can always scroll and manipulate any one I want.

The widget should have a header and a footer with the footer having the copyright symbol and text "Electric Fields and Charges Explorer"

Design an educational web application to help me learn fundamental Korean language elements.

Key features:

Basic Hangul (Korean alphabet) display:
-Show a grid of Korean consonants and vowels

-Simple vocabulary flashcards:
-Display a Korean word in Hangul
-Show its English translation

Multiple-choice quiz:

Present a Korean word or simple phrase
Offer 3-4 possible English translations
Provide immediate feedback on user's selection (correct/incorrect)

Technical requirements:
- On click of any of the Korean alphabet cards should play the sound (Utilize webspeech API) In the case of the consonants, these cannot be pronounced alone so show a reference of it paired with another hangul letter to form a pronunciation.
-Single HTML file (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
-Clean, minimalist design that works on both desktop and mobile
-Clear, intuitive user interface with simple controls
-Ensure accurate content for Korean characters, words, and translations

Additional considerations:
Start with a small set of common words and phrases (e.g., 20-30 items)
Include a basic instructions or "How to Use" section, this should be the first selected section in the navigation, to explain the tool.

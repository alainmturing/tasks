I'm a high school physics teacher and need your assistance with buildng an educational tool to teach my class kinematgics. What I want is for you to codee me up a single html file with css and js and utilize whatever libraries you need to make the best educational tool as possible. The tool should have 4 sections with a visually appealing nav bar that highlights the section selected, the default being set to Introduction tab at the beginning. The Introduction section'll have a brief a brief introduction to kinematics and describe some key terms. The next section is 1 dimensional motion. I need you to describe one dimensional motion, the equations of motion, and even provide a real world example. This section should also have a customizeable graph where the user can input acceleration in (m/s^2) and Time range in (s) to plot the Velocity-time graph. next section will be titled Motion graphs and will showcase a displacement time graph and an acceleration time graph, once again customizeable with inputs by the user. The last section will be interactive exercises and will give the user a couple exercises and allow them to check the answer. They should also have access to a hint button that will tell them what formula they need to use to reach the answer but should not give them the answer. Please make it visually appealing, thanks!

Create a browser based, side-scrolling bubble shooter game.

Here’s a lil description of the game I want.

I want the character to be able to move up and down using the arrow keys and they need to shoot bubbles that animate around the screen with random displacement. The character will have a gun like weapon that shoots sharp objects. The bubbles should be red in color to cue to the user that they’re dangerous. If the character comes in contact with any of the bubbles, they lose a life. The user has only 3 lives. Once they lose 3 lives the game is over. The score will be calculated using the amount of time the user spends alive and how many bubbles they shoot successfully. The aim for the user is to shoot and dodge the bubbles as they move through the game.

Key Features:

	•	Controls: Mouse click or space to shoot. Up and down arrows to move character up and down.
	•	Levels: Easy, Difficult, Hard. Difficulty increases bubble spawn frequency and faster game movement.
	•	Score: +5 points for every second alive, +1 for every bubble shot.
	•	Graphics: Character, Gun, Bubbles all built using the best JavaScript library available for these kinds of graphics.
	•	Sound: Sound effects for shooting using webaudio api

Requirements:

Single HTML file containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Sound effects using Web Audio API

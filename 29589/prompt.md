Key features:  
- Interactive virtual drum pad with multiple sound banks. 
- Upon click of a sound bank, it plays that sound and activates it for adding to the timeline grid explained next.  
- 16 step Timeline grid for sequencing beats that when a step is clicked, it sets that step in the timeline to that sound so that we can do playback of the beat made. 
- Make sure that upon playback I can see which step it is at in the playback along with hearing the sound play. 
- Make sure that when I select a sound, it is highlighted so I know I am modifying with that sound. 
- Tempo control slider (60-180 BPM)
- Information cards for different drum sounds and their roles

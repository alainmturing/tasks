Create a browser based game side-scrolling game called Space Rocket

here's what I want you to build

I want you to build a beautiful game canvas that looks like space, and I want you to create a visually appealing graphic for the rocket which will be the character that the user will move throughout the game. It doesn't have to exactly look like a rocket but I just want the physics of the movement to be really smooth. Utilize libraries such as three.js and Phaser to create the best possible game. The user should be able to use all 4 arrow keys to move the rocket as well as combining keys like up and right, right and down for different angles of movements. Be sure to code the proper physics for this type of movement of the rocket to create a smooth and seamless rocket flow through space.

That's about the movement of the character, now more for the goals. The user should move their rocket through space and avoid random spawning meteors as they move throughout space in a side-scrolling manner. Their score will be determined by the distance they travel and will be prominently displayed at the top center of the screen in a visually appealing box with border and shadow and proper styling for the text and box. The game should also have a game sound playing as the user navigates through space utilizing webaudio api.

Requirements:

Single HTML file containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Sound effects using Web Audio API
Game graphics and physics utilizing game libraries such as Phaser, Three.js etc.

Key to note:

Up and down arrow to steer the rocket, meteros increease in speed and frequency as difficulty increases with the different levels. Oh yeah we need to allow the user to select their level(difficulty) at the beginning of the game. ALso, when they lose theyh should be able to restart the game with the same dificulty or choose to go back to level slecltion to select a new levle.

The game ends when the user collides with a meteor by the way.

Also I need the there to be collision sound effect as well as a continuous game sound going, make it whatever but use the webaudio api.

Hey, I want you to help me build a browser game where you slice flying fruits. Here's what I'm thinking:

Three level selection before starting the game. Upon resetting the game should go back to this screen.
Fruits launch up into the air from the bottom of the screen where they spawn at random intervals and then they fall back down. They should launch at random heights whereas the range of height at which they launch is determined by the difficulty level. Choose appropriate height ranges for each difficulty using your own discretion.
Utilize realistic physics for the fruits launching up into the air and falling down.
For each difficulty level, modify the launch heights and drop speed. For easy level they launch higher and fall slower, for hard level they launch lower and fall faster, medium is a balance between the two.
Use the mouse to slice fruits before they fly off screen.
The user should have a knife as their mouse cursor using a knife emoji but it should be sizeable enough to represent an actual knife and should replace the mouse cursor.
Different levels with faster fruits as you go
Score points for sliced fruits, lose points for missed ones.
Fruit graphics using emojis whose size is dependent on the difficulty level. Easy - big fruits, Medium - medium fruits, Hard - small fruits
Slicing sound effects to make it fun using WebAudio API

Game rules:
- Game ends when user misses to slice a single fruit.

Make it all in one HTML file with some JavaScript and CSS
Make it visually appealing with a nice background appropriate for the game.

Create a browser-based educational visualization to help me understand the manufacturing process of semiconductors

Key Features:

Interactive step-by-step walkthrough of the semiconductor manufacturing process, from raw silicon to finished chip.
3D models of key processes used in semiconductor fabrication. They don't have to be perfect but should atleast resemble.
Zoom-in capabilities for each model
Pop quizzes on toggle to assess understanding of semiconductor manufacturing concepts.

Technical Requirements:

Single HTML file (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
use three.js javascript library to create the 3d models.
Intuitive navigation through the manufacturing stages.
User-friendly interface for interacting with 3D models.
Smooth transitions between different stages of the manufacturing process.
